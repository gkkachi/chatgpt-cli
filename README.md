This script is a simple chatbot program that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate responses to user input. It prompts the user for input using a command-line interface and sends the user input to the GPT-3.5 model for processing. The model generates a response that is printed to the console.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following dependencies:

- `readline`: a Node.js module for reading input from the console.
- `openai`: a Node.js client for OpenAI's GPT-3 API.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Run the script using `node index.js`.
4. The script will prompt you to provide some input. Enter your input and press Enter.
5. The script will send your input to the GPT-3.5 model and print the response to the console.
6. The script will prompt you again for input. Repeat steps 4-5 to continue the conversation.

Note that the script uses a default system input of "You are a helpful assistant." if no input is provided at startup.

## Configuration

The script has the following configuration options:

- `CHAT_MODEL`: The name of the GPT-3.5 model to use for generating responses. Change this to use a different model.
- `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_INPUT`: The default system input to use if no input is provided at startup. Change this to use a different default.
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: The prompt to display when asking for the initial system input. Change this to use a different prompt.
- `USER_PROMPT`: The prompt to display when asking for user input. Change this to use a different prompt.
- `BOT_PROMPT`: The prompt to display before printing the bot's response. Change this to use a different prompt.
